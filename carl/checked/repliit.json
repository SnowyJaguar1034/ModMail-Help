  "description": "While this may seem like a nice and free service, it has a lot more caveats than you might think, such as:\n- The machines are super underpowered.\n - This means your bot will lag a lot as it gets bigger.\n- You need to run a webserver alongside your bot to prevent it from being shut off. (I don't think this is an issue for ModMail).\n- Repl.it uses an ephemeral file system.\n - This means any file you saved via your bot will be overwritten when you next launch.\n- They use a shared IP for everything running on the service.\n - This one is important, if someone is running a user bot on their service and gets banned, everyone on that IP will be banned. **Including you.**",
