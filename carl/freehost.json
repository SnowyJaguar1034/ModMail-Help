This is why they give you a domain name and open a port on their local emulator.\n- Heroku's environment is heavily containerized, making it significantly underpowered for a standard use case.\n- Heroku's environment is volatile.\n - In order to handle the insane amount of users trying to use it for their own applications, Heroku will dispose of your environment every time your application dies unless you pay.\n- Heroku has minimal system dependency control.\n - This is the reason why voice doesn't work natively on Heroku.\n- Heroku only offers a limited amount of time on their free program for your applications. If you exceed this limit, which you probably will, they'll shut down your application until your free credit resets.",
