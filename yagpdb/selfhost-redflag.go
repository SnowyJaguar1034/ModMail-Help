(I don't think this is an issue for ModMail).\n- Repl.it uses an ephemeral file system.\n - This means any file you saved via your bot will be overwritten when you next launch.\n- They use a shared IP for everything running on the service.\n - This one is important, if someone is running a user bot on their service and gets banned, everyone on that IP will be banned. **Including you.**"
